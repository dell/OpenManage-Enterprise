 .SYNOPSIS
   Script to get the list of devices which are not capable of power monitoring with OMEnt-Power Manager
 .DESCRIPTION
   This script exercises the OME REST API to get a list of devices which are 
   not capable of power monitoring with OMEnt-Power Manager
   currently being managed by that instance. For authentication X-Auth
   is used over Basic Authentication
   Note :
        1)The credentials entered are not stored to disk.
        2)This script doesn't take into account devices with iDRAC Firmware version 4.0.0.0
 .PARAMETER IpAddress
   This is the IP address of the OME Appliance
 .PARAMETER Credentials
   Credentials used to talk to the OME Appliance
   Credentials used to talk to the OME Appliance
   
 .EXAMPLE
   $cred = Get-Credential
   .\Find_non_PMP_capable_devices.ps1 -IpAddress "10.xx.xx.xx" -Credentials $cred
 .EXAMPLE
   .\Find_non_PMP_capable_devices.ps1 -IpAddress "10.xx.xx.xx"
   In this instance you will be prompted for credentials to use
 .EXAMPLE 
  To save the device Ids to a file(file_name.txt) give the command in following format 
  .\Find_non_PMP_capable_devices.ps1 -IpAddress "10.xx.xx.xx" -Credentials $cred >file_name.txt
