## OME/OME-M and Plugin API Samples / Cookbooks

This repository hosts cookbooks for OME/OME-M and associated plugins. Script examples specific to OME/OME-M are in the Core directory. Plugin script examples are in the "Plugin" folder and categorized further by plugin name.

The Core directory is further subdivided into Python and PowerShell. We do our best to maintain functional equivalance between the two, but sometimes they differ. These differences are typically noted in [the docs](docs/API.md).

## Script Documentation

For a listing of each script and its accompanying documentation see our [Example API Documentation](docs/API.md)

## Requests

If there is a script you would like feel free to put a request [on our issues](https://github.com/dell/OpenManage-Enterprise/issues). This repository is maintained in our free time, but we're happy to take a look at things the community needs. The more descriptive you can be about exactly what you want the better. Screenshots of exactly the functionality you are looking for are fantastic!

## Problems

If you run into problems with a script you can post [on our issues](https://github.com/dell/OpenManage-Enterprise/issues). If possible, provide the exact command you ran to generate the problem, any OME configurations required to recreate it, or if it's a code problem you already found - a good description of where the problem is.
