## Requests

If there is a script you would like feel free to put a request [on our issues](https://github.com/dell/OpenManage-Enterprise/issues). This repository is maintained in our free time, but we're happy to take a look at things the community needs. The more descriptive you can be about exactly what you want the better. Screenshots of exactly the functionality you are looking for are fantastic!

## Problems

If you run into problems with a script you can post [on our issues](https://github.com/dell/OpenManage-Enterprise/issues). If possible, provide the exact command you ran to generate the problem, any OME configurations required to recreate it, or if it's a code problem you already found - a good description of where the problem is.

## Documentation

We are currently working on creating script documentation. Right now the header of each script contains a description and some of the Python code follows docstring standards.
