#### Synopsis
Refreshes the inventory on a set of target devices. This includes the configuration inventory tab.

#### Description
This script uses the OME REST API to refresh the inventory of a targeted server. It performs X-Auth
with basic authentication. Note: Credentials are not stored on disk.

#### Python Example
`python invoke_refresh_inventory.py -i 192.168.1.93 -u admin -p somepass --idrac-ips 192.168.1.63,192.168.1.45`
