## OME Integration with Kafka

### Overview 

This repository shows examples of how to visualize the OME [metrics](./Metrics/README.md) and [alerts](./Alerts/README.md) sent to a Kafka broker in a Grafana dashboard. It uses open source components like vector and victoriametrics/victorialogs to format the data received by Kafka and show it in Grafana dashboard.

Note: This solution is to be used as a reference/example. It is by no means a comprehensive collection of visualizations which can be shown in Grafana.
